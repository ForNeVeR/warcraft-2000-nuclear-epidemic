WarCraft 2000: Nuclear Epidemic
===============================
A game by [GSC Game World][gsc] from 1998.

The developers made the game sources available on the game disk and left the following note in `help.txt` (translation from Russian):

> WARCRAFT 2000 was written in 1998. For nine months, a group of four people tried to surpass the technical capabilities of WARCRAFT2, STARCRAFT. This version of the game will never be licensed, which is why our outfit did not try to make a bestseller, we just wanted to improve the good old WARCRAFT2. But nine months is quite a long time. Lack of funding and fading enthusiasm forced us to finish the project at the stage at which you see it.

The source license was never clarified aside from this note, and all the sources are provided as-is.

This repository contains the full contents of the `SOURCE.War2000` directory of the original game disk. Want to explore the disk yourself? Get the image on [My Abandonware][my-abandonware].
